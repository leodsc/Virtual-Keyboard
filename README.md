# Virtual-Keyboard

Create a simple virtual keyboard

It is possible to click in the buttons to add content to the text area in HTML, as well clicking in the keyboard keys. It will trigger the key clicked effect in the virtual keyboard. In order to make the trigger work, you must click in the text area, otherwise just the caps lock key will be triggered when clicked.
Next updates will include customizations avaliable in the keyboard.

Testing git.
